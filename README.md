# hello-world-workflow

A tiny test CWL workflow written to help develop new features for Toil.
Also not a bad toy example for introducing yourself to CWL workflows.

## Running the workflow with Toil

Theoretically this should work with any CWL runner that supports
scattering and sub-workflows; but, assuming you want to use Toil:

1. First install Toil with the CWL extra by running

    ```
    pip install 'toil[cwl]'
    ```

2. Install Docker by following [Docker's install docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/) (or otherwise)

3. Run the main workflow with

    ```
    toil-cwl-runner hello_world_scatter_workflow.cwl config.yaml
    ```

If you want to get fancy by using Toil's advanced features, such as
autoscaling for AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, consult the
[official Toil documentation](http://toil.readthedocs.io/).

## Workflow breakdown

In the config file, [`config.yaml`](config.yaml), we have two lists: a
list of names, and a list of numbers. The main workflow,
[`hello_world_scatter_workflow.cwl`](hello_world_scatter_workflow.cwl),
"scatters" (i.e., takes every combination of) the names and numbers, and
runs each combination through the subworkflow
[`hello_world_subworkflow.cwl`](hello_world_subworkflow.cwl), which runs
the following steps:

### hello_world

The hello_world step takes a name and number and prints a unique "hello
world" message to a file.

### duplicate_file

The duplicate_file step takes the file from hello_world and duplicates
it into two separate files. This step is (needlessly) run in the
`node:slim` Docker container, to incorporate the Docker feature into the
workflow for testing purposes.

### make_caps

The make_caps step takes the files from duplicate_file and converts all
their alphabetic characters to uppercase and creates a new directory
with these converted files.

By default the final output directories created by make_caps should
appear in the base directory of the repository.
